### Pages, Sites, Applications

### Pages, Sites, Applications

## Pages
A document served over the internet
* Generally static presentation for all comers

##### Simple
---
### Pages, Sites, Applications

## Sites
Collection of pages
* meant to partition information
* provide higher level ordering
* encapsulate domains
* still fairly static
* may attempt statefulness

##### Simple-ish

---
### Pages, Sites, Applications

## Applications
Interface to effect change and hold/manage state
* needs statefulness
* needs to consider the server/client relationship
* highly dynamic content

##### Complex (usually)

### Tech Stacks

---

### Tech Stack

Traditional server based web applications ahve

* **Persistence** Tier for long term information storage
* **Processing** Tier for executing application logic
* **Interaction** Tier for negoatiating server/client communication
* **Presentation** Tier for showing human usable application interface

Commonly this is

1. SQL
2. Java
3. Tomcat + Servlet API + HTTP
4. JSP + the browser

---
### the stack can get in the way

## Why is this hard?

HTTP is by design stateless.

* No pre-defined page order
* No implicit sequence awareness

---
### the stack can get in the way

## Problems

* requires tracking cookies to traverse the wire on every request
* requires memory on server to keep track of state
* requires the client to infer state on each page reload

### Partitioning Client and Server

---

### Partitioning Client and Server

## Traditional Web Application

##### Server
* Database
* Business Logic
* Routing
* Presentation Logic

##### Interface
* HTTP GET
* HTTP Form Post

##### Client
* Static HTML markup


---

### Partitioning Client and Server

## SPA Web Application

##### Server
* Database
* Business Logic

##### Interface
* HTTP verbs against REST endpoints
* JSON (data) instead of HTML (markup)

##### Client
* Routing
* Presentation Logic

### Benefits

---

### Benefits

* State can live where it is useful, on the client
* Reduces server overhead in tracking sessions
* expands presentation options
* Offline support?
* Accessibility to other platforms
  * IOS/Android
  * Desktop Applications
  * Internet of Things
  * Anything that's not a browser

### Its not about SPAs
## It is about decoupling

---
class: center, middle

### Frameworks and Examples

---

### Frameworks and Examples

## AngularJS
an MVC framework for your browser

Views (HTML and directives) are bound to Controllers (actually called Controllers) and build/maintain/manage Models with Services/Factories

State is stored in Service Singletons and Scope objects.

---
### Frameworks and Examples

from [https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_07](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_07)

```js
phonecatApp.config(['$routeProvider',
  function($routeProvider) {
    $routeProvider.
      when('/phones', {
        templateUrl: 'partials/phone-list.html',
        controller: 'PhoneListCtrl'
      }).
      when('/phones/:phoneId', {
        templateUrl: 'partials/phone-detail.html',
        controller: 'PhoneDetailCtrl'
      }).
      otherwise({
        redirectTo: '/phones'
      });
  }]);
```

---
### Frameworks and Examples

## Twitter

mounts new profiles without reloading entire page.

Follow and Unfollow actions are POSTed to API url with JSON

Partial timeline data is loaded as needed and injected into the html context

---
### Frameworks and Examples

## National Programs Database

Uses a component to bind URL to React Components. If you manipulte the URL the handler is remounted.

underlying Brand and Program data is just there waiting to be used.
